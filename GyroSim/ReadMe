The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and practical system to
understand how the gyroscope operates by reading the values of the Pmod and then
converting it to make it readable using the Oled Pmod and by utilizing button
interrupts you are able to either see the direct change in movement through
coordinates or see it practically by seeing an object move using the movement
from zybo board.
